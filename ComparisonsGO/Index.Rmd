# RNA-Seq Analysis for ComparisonGO Project:


Comparison A: Felce resting v stimulated VS Zhao 0h v 2h

Comparison B: Felce resting v stimulated VS Zhao 0h v 24h

Comparison C: Felce resting v stimulated VS Lucic resting v activated

Comparison D: Zhao 0h v 24h VS Lucic resting v activated

Comparison E: Zhao 0h v 2h VS Zhao 0h v 24h

Using +/- 1 LFC Venn lists, separate each one to:

A Felce only, A Zhao only, A Both

B Felce only, B Zhao only, B Both

C Felce only, C Lucic only, C Both

D Zhao only, D Lucic only, D Both

E Zhao 2h only, E Zhao 24h only, E Both

2 x lists for each one (up/down)

Do Gene Ontology for each comparison - biological process, cellular component, molecular function.
